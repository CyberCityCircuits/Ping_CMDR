Ping_CMDR Change Log

V0.01
***	Set up main menu and tried to get the device ping to work, but had issues.

V0.02
***	Created the UI and added script to ping CMDR, EZR, POS1, and POS2.
***	Added script to show if online or not by pinging http://www.google.com.

V0.03.00
***	Added script to UI lines to show red characters when the status is 'Down'.  This worked fine on my programming terminal, but on other's workstations it didn't work.

V0.03.01
***	Took scripting out for the red 'Down' characters.  Made all text a brighter white.
